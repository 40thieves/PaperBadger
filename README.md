Exploring the use of digital badges for crediting contributors to scholarly papers for their work

As the research environment becomes more digital, we want to test how we can use this medium to help bring transparency and credit for individuals in the publication process.

This work is a collaboration with publishers [BioMed Central](http://www.biomedcentral.com/) (BMC) and the [Public Library of Science](http://www.plos.org/) (PLoS); the biomedical research foundation, [The Wellcome Trust](http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/); the software and technology firm [Digital Science](http://www.digital-science.com/); the registry of unique researcher identifiers, [ORCID](http://orcid.org/); and the [Mozilla Science Lab](http://mozillascience.org/).
